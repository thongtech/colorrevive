## üéØ Use Cases

ColorRevive is designed to help in various scenarios:

### 1. **Mourning Period Websites**
Many websites, particularly in Thailand and other Asian countries, apply grayscale filters during mourning periods as a mark of respect. While culturally significant, this can make content difficult to read, especially on websites with media and images.

**Example:** Thai government websites, news portals, and banks often apply `filter: grayscale(100%)` during national mourning periods.

### 2. **Accessibility Improvements**
Some users find grayscale websites harder to read due to:
- Reduced contrast making text less legible
- Difficulty distinguishing UI elements
- Eye strain from monochrome displays
- Confusion in colour-coded information
